 Q1 . Why did you choose to pursue a Full Stack Android Developer Course?
Q2. How has your experience been at Masai School?.
Before writing an essay to a specific topic I have
divided that topic into two parts 1) Full Stack Android Developer Course. 2) How my experience has been in Masai till now.
Touching to the first point Why I have chosen the FS-AD course is due to MPL. The domain of Massai came to know in the month of February 2021 from my real brother. This time I was enjoying playing games on mobile, due to the Lockdown situation I was reading books and playing MPL on mobile. Lots of winning and but little losing happens while playing small fantasy “Fruit Cutter, MotoBike, Slice Fruit” games. But special enjoyment was with money in this period I used to play and win prizes in the form of money and directly to the mapped bank and also I was in the top 10 of the MPL leaderboard.
After some time in between April I joined the Masai through Bootcamp. “Tic-Tac-Toe” was project building for a day. I got selected and got an interview call then welcome on Masai’s platform. The main motivation for joining Masai is the MPL gaming platform. It was very impressive due to the MPL android app. In the corona phase nearly the jobs of

 people were downside. If a job is there then a person gets some percentage limit of his whole salary. The Economic GDP of India was collapsing. The world is trying to face inflation. Everything was just calm and quiet, But the world’s and small scale Tech. industry was growing rapidly. I realised that if I would be making such an application which will see youth skills on a gaming platform so I decided to go to the root of that application this was the reason for joining the FS-AND batch of Masai school. After enrollment into Masai I realised that Android developers are the excel course for me rather than FS-WEB. From that day I started to study hard, complete all assignments, assessments, Quizzes, DSA, up to date. Day by day I was feeling “Yes”. I became a 30% developer the next day. 32% I was realizing that I am developing skills which are required for an Android developer. I need to study more to achieve 210 days life skills, tool skills, coding skills, required for SDE 1 developer, so I started to put (QQD) technique taught us by Yogesh Quantity, Quality, Direction. Within a few days of curriculum relation between me and Masai was very heart touching and sometimes I feel that why I have not joined before? But late it time nevers stops, and quitters never win.
Later Java curriculum instructor Lloyd who is one of the finest curriculum tutoring for us his syllabi was going to finish after one month, then skillathon session conducted by Yogesh, Maithri, Shruti all teammates session were

 awesome that were also going to finish what a beautiful journey from 21 April, till now. I was very impressed with the Masai’s tagline “Learn To Earn, Pay When You Get Hired”. Later we were introduced to the “Glide Program” the concept put forth by co-founder Pratik Shukla was awesome due to the glide program many of the students got their life stable. The concept behind the program was to see hidden talents from students. Every day into Masai School was full of opportunity if you grab it going to make a beautiful life, every day new things were thought, opportunity and struggle were just close friends to me every day. Then at last I was on board for unit interviews. At last I would like to say my journey in Masai will never stop because Masai is my heartbeat.
